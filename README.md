# About project

This is a one-page web application that allows you to track the weather in various cities around the world. 
It provides various information about the temperature in Celsius, wind direction, moon phases, and so on. 
As well as the ability to view the temperature forecast for 16 days ahead. 
The Windy widget was also used in the project, which is a map that reflects many different ifnormations, 
for example, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere. 
Currently, the widget does not support auto-finding the city from the search bar.
